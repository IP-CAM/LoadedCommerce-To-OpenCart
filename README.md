# Migrating From LoadedCommerce To Open Cart 2.X
Migrate database from LoadedCommerce (osCommerce rebranded) to OpenCart 2.X

I setup a scotch vagrant box, installed Open Cart 2 (latest) and then created another database where I imported a dump from this shopping cart I've been tasked w/ migrating. I recommend you do it this way because you don't want to go making mistakes on a in production eCommerce site unless you really hate the person paying you.
